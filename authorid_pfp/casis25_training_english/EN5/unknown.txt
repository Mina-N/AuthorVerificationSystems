Coming to the point of education and outreach, nothing can beat the 'Black Hole' phenomena that suddenly glamorized particle physics all over the world, particularly in India. This is one example where a Mega science project caught the imagination (literally - remember the imaginary end of the world on Sept 10th 2008) and popularized science in the country. Little known CERN Laboratory in Geneva became the buzzword for all of September 2008 and thereafter. Several Institutes, students and teaching staff from remote corners of the country became interested to forge partnerships, sending interns and becoming part of the phenomena. As a very miniscule part of all this I had the proud privilege of hosting 11 Indian students for the very first time this summer at CERN. These students from the field of engineering were working as interns in various technological fields and have created a proud impact both at CERN, and in the country.

We absolutely need to continue and take these partnerships to another dimension namely bringing the large science into each classroom and into the common man's life.

What are commercial benefits from Mega Science projects?

As an incubator for invention and for the development of new products, services, ideas and organizations, cross-disciplinary frontier research results in ambitious initiatives. Did anyone predict the colossal impact the World Wide Web, developed at CERN for sharing scientific data among collaborators? To propose and defend a bold idea is only possible within a framework of likeminded competent people which is provided by a Mega Project.
