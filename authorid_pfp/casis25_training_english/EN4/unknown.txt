I called Yogi and some other people who lived close by. Yogi's first and useful suggestion was to call an agency that supplied nurses. I do that and the agency says that the earliest a nurse can reach my west Delhi house is atleast a couple of hours. Bereft of choice, I agree and hope that it would be sooner rather than later than a couple of hours for the promised nurse.

In the meantime, in the absence of any understanding as to what could be the cause for my father's strange behaviour, I call up his cardiologist who lives and practices in our neighbourhood. He refuses to come home asking me to bring my father to the clinic instead. How do I that? If I could get him to sit still enough to drive him to the doctor, would I be panicking and asking him to come home? Is a patient's well-being only the responsibility of family members and not the medical profession?

Maybe it's the helplessness in my voice that makes the cardiologist suggest a psychiatrist who may have the answer to my father's medical problem. The psychiatrist comes in early afternoon and takes one look at my father and passes the verdict: "It's dementia". He prescribes a liquid sleep drug to sedate my father, and after pocketing a sizeable amount as his consultation, is off and away in about 10 minutes.
