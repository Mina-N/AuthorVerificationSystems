Narendra Modi always hogs the headlines and always generates sharp responses of two kinds. One from the people who believe Modi is the future of India, natural choice for the Prime Ministership, India's development-man, modern, determined and decisive. Industrialists say he made Gujarat an ideal state for their industries where decisions are not dependent on red-tapism. Ratan Tata and Mukesh Ambani see a PM in Modi. He is the only leader in BJP with a mass following and admirers outside the party. Modi is perhaps the only Indian politician to have a cult status on the social media. You may not get any feedback when you write on other leaders on Twitter or Facebook, but one piece on Modi and there is a barrage of hate- or fan-mails.

Modi, of course, has another image too. The villain of the 2002 riots. The man who divides the Hindus and the Muslims. Despite all the claims of development and harmony, Modi has not been able to reach out to the victims of the riots. They still await justice. Modi is abhorred by the secularists. Modi, on his part, also doesn't care about carrying all sections of the society along. Dictator, destructive and defiant. All those who nudged him the wrong way paid for it, whether it be the state bureaucracy or his fellow leaders in BJP. Modi is not a believer in equality. He is the party as well as the government in Gujarat. The megalomaniac is too tall for anybody in the state. His compatriots are scared of him. Speaking out of turn and without Modi's permission invites his wrath and even jeopardizes careers.
