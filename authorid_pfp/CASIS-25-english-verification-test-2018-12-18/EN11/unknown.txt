Much of the debate about whether to intervene in Syria or not is taking place in a strange ahistorical vacuum. As with so much debate about humanitarian intervention the underlying world view is of a simplified story of bad dictators and good, well intentioned westerners who must somehow intervene to stop him. But the truth is that America has a very complicated relationship with Syria which stretches back over sixty years. Back in the 1950s America set out to intervene in Syria, liberate the people from a corrupt elite, and bring about a new democracy.
