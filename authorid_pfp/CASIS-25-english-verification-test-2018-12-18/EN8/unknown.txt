In 1991, the country had been in the grip of Ram Lehar (Ram Mandir wave) but for the tragic assassination of former PM Rajiv Gandhi, BJP would have swept majority of the states. A minority government was formed under the leadership of Narasimha Rao. It is only a coincidence that Rao (and not a Gandhi icon) was chosen to lead the Congress as after Rajiv's tragic death his widow Sonia Gandhi refused to enter politics; Rahul and Priyanka were too small then.
