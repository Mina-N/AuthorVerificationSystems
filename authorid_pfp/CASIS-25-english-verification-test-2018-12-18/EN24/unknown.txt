I therefore need to revise my earlier claim that speakers will take any shortcuts they can which do not affect clarity of communication: we have to strike the right balance between taking cognitive shortcuts  like not bothering to stop the larynx vibrating  and how we want to be perceived by our audience. Plus, it is important to keep in mind that these processes take place almost entirely below the level of conscious control. As users of language, we balance the demands on us as speakers with the needs of the hearer all the time in a way that (we hope) maximises our communicative goals but keeps us in tune with the expectations of our interlocutors.
