In 2005, the Karnataka region implemented a large-scale modernization plan for a land transport company (KSRTC). In the Kerala region, we barely got the fruits without hard work. Bandana is still in contact with white criminal elephants. For example, consider the possibility of providing a bus on the first floor of the coach. It was considered an important step for the current age. However, KSRTC was proud of the popularity of this bus, but its sales declined. After the Volvo branch refused the coupon before paying the fare, the installation of this bus became the initial problem. On the bus, the subway bus was very far away. The company did not have 40 rubles of catastrophic rubies to pay for repairs. Maybe they had to apply for an unsecured loan from the DLF (a bad joke, but ultimately, the Vader season). Regarding the bus, there was a second-tier service loss in Thiruvananthapuram and the new conversion service. Of the 5000 ATMs distributed to ticket sellers, 2000 have recently been declared bankrupt! Due to the company Kerala Financial Development, the company announced an ambitious plan for the modernization of the bus sector. This announcement was announced to the Board of Directors in 2008 and represents a recovery of rupee deposits. 1000 in two years. It's 2012 now.
