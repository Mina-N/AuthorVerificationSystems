Me, sabhle pehle My introduction. So here I am an ordinary Delhi Kadaband. I was born here, the school pushed me here, I struggled at college, now I will earn a living in this city. You know the average Delhi person. A decent Punjab accent and song group from Honey Singh reminiscent of the dilli haat in winter hesitates with refering to it as Connaught Square instead Rajiv Chowk. Leisure traffic signals are for skipping.

Let's talk, ladies. First because it is the first day of the New Year: Happy New Year. This year, you are rich and happy. But wait. Maybe next year, we should not use the qualities of this limit, right? Words that instantly create visions of smiling faces, laughter, harmonious life, etc. It's not realistic, right? I mean, 15 days ago someone was raped in my city. They attacked with iron bars and got off the bus to die and die. This is not the first time I read this word in the newspaper. I always read that word, nodded and thought: "Kitne Kameene, hotein hain kuch log". Then turn the page. Gangrape. Bora Hai, but hota hain, I say to myself. Huta Hai, in these remote villages of Rajasthan or Bihar. Hota-Hain at 3:30 in the morning. Hota hai, in a world that does not cross my world.
