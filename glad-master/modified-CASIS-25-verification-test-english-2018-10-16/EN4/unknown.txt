With the civil war done, a large number of military personnel are no longer required to perform military service, and it is necessary to return to agriculture. This is the only profession they know. The new government faces its first real challenge. As a result of the conflict and civil war, heavily cultivated land was developed and the location of these mines is unknown. Agricultural land must be restored quickly, otherwise the resulting unemployment will lead to chaos. India can provide better assistance in this regard. 

Much depends on how the new state deals with key issues of maintaining warring tribes as a state and managing its relationship with the Arab North. Both sides have already avoided major incidents of violence in the last five years. But they failed to overcome decades of mutual mistrust in convincing southerners to embrace unity. Paradoxically, most of the oil fields in this oil-rich country are located in the south, while pipelines and export ports are in the north. This interdependence is expected to have a positive impact and provide the essence of long-term peace and cooperation with the Arab Sudan. Since India enjoys good relations with the Sudanese people, we can once again offer mutually beneficial assistance to the new country.

The problem in Sudan provides motive to India to re-establish itself as a major global player and take the space that China will be moving from due to changing circumstances in the place. There is also a history of Indian presence in the Sudan area.
