Citizen, my citizen. I think my problem lies in this starting point. With the exception of friends and relatives, I do not think citizens are people like you. I did not do this. For me, you are like everyone else ... because people like you are not "ideal goals". But you are not my citizen. My mission is to protect mothers, sisters, wives and friends. Then, when someone was transported in a crowded DTC bus, someone was touched and I listened to an ipod on the same bus. When a motorcyclist commented on you at the city traffic lights, I was riding past in the car to watch the cricket match on television. When one of you was groped in the bustling market, I bought gifts for my family in the same market. Now, when these sick waters rush to my door, I realize that when the flood enters the city, I should try to help set up the roadblock. I realize that even if one woman in this country is affected by this epidemic, I will assume unacceptable responsibilities and progressively as it comes closer to mine.
