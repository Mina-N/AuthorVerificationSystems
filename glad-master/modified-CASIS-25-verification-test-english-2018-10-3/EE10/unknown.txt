What KSRTC needs is an "intelligent plan". Just change the priority. Locations and divisions. Currently, KSRTC provides city services in cities such as Kochi and Thiruvananthapuram, and provides long-distance services intra and inter state. Most companies are managed centrally or locally breeding inefficiency. As can be seen from this news report, coordination is very low and there are still many disadvantages to capitalizing replication services and routes. This needs simplification of operations and administration. KSRTC is ideally suited to start independent city services as a separate entity. Eliminating municipal nonprofit inventories can help your parent company switch funds to maintain and modernize your most profitable long-haul fleet. Private Combination. In Delhi, most bus routes are operated by Delhi carriers. The advantage of this is the uniformity of rates and services. But the situation is different in Kerala. Public transport in the city is largely dependent on private buses. However, this private bus operator is operating on often their own law. Greed causes work at a decisive pace, with little care for passengers or pedestrians. Private operators, most of whom run a small number of buses, complain that they must be cautious to to adhere to unrealistic schedules. The KSRTC has several years' experience running a large fleet. It could discover launching services in probinces like Kochi on a Public-Private Partnership model. KSRTC could partner with private bus owners wherein buses and resources are pooled to rationalise operations and profits.
