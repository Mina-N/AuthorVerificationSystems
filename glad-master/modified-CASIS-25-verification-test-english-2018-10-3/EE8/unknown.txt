Any criticism is clearly positive. It would be the last choice of Manmohan Singh. At the press conference, Manmohan Singh's predictions were slim and Rahul Gandhi was an important candidate. This speech does not talk about partying, but partying. Politically, the president of the Congress, who changed Rahul Gandhi into a "shipwreck", committed suicide. The parliamentary group hopes that the deputy speaker will join the opposition party, continue the parliamentary reconstruction and rebuild the lost relationship between the main Indian party and Am Ami. The most important question that the US UU Congress needs to think about now is whether Rough Gandhi did his best. The unpredictability of the policy is attractive, but lawmakers who do not allow the commitment will not bet on the political parties related to "Uverage" and "Dynasty of the dynasty". Congressional activist Raful Gandhi came to the unofficial conclusion that he was known "in the afternoon" in the parliamentary elections and that he did not have the support of Indian voters. Rahul is an unattractive and uncomfortable politician, and vertical images do not affect voters in urban and rural areas. Sonia Gandhi said the candidate for the post of prime minister will be announced in the 2014 general election, but Sonia Gandhi is ready to stop the assembly. The only aesthetic change of Sonia Gandhi will make the Congress a true democrat and the president of the Congress will leave Adam? In addition, do these basic changes announced by Supreme Commander in this section refer to non-executives like Rough Gandhi? The resumption of parliament also means that the prime minister chooses non-Gandhi elections as a popular candidate for Moody in parliament. Do you really have this leader in Congress?
