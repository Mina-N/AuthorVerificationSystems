ìBased upon the information that has been obtained, the decision has been made to initiate steps to terminate those employees.î

Wood lived with his brother, Cameron, at the home of their and Wood-Harberís father in Oklahoma. (Wood-Harber has a different mother and lives in Arkansas.)

Cameron, then 14, had told his sister they were being neglected in the weeks before Wood died, she said. Wood-Harber said she alerted Oklahoma Child Welfare Services in December 2012. She called Child Welfare Services every day for three weeks, she said, until Woodís death on 4 January.

Wood-Harber said that a social worker visited Wood at school but a follow-up visit at his home was not carried out.

ìIf Oklahoma Child Welfare Services had done their job and followed through with a home visit, they would have found Quinten and Cameronís living conditions deplorable,î Wood-Harber said in the petition, adding that intervention ìcould have saved Quintenís lifeî.

DHS said a criminal investigation into Woodís death is ongoing.

Michael Wood, Quintenís father, has previously denied that he was at fault.

ìIf I didnít care properly for Quinten, he wouldnít have lived 15 years, especially when we were told that he wouldnít live to see a year,î he told CNN in October 2013.

Wood-Harberís petition called on the Governor of Oklahoma to investigate Oklahoma Child Welfare Services and Midwest City public schools ìto hold neglectful parties responsible for my brotherís death and ensure other children donít suffer the way he didî. It has almost 500,000 signatures to date.
