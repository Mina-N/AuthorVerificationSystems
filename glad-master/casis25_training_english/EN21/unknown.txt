Caesar divorced her; his parting shot to Pompeia was "Caesar's wife must be above suspicion." But the charges against Pompeia were never proven.

Indian judges today find themselves in the same soup that Pompeia was in, 2000 years back. Charges are flying thick over their personal integrity. And it's a serious matter. This time the charges against judges have those from the Supreme and High Courts facing the heat. It is these judges who are being put under the scanner.

The latest charge is against Justice H K Sema, retired judge of the Supreme Court. Sema is accused of being partial to UP Chief Minister Mayawati, and in return was allegedly rewarded by being appointed the chairman of the UP Human rights commission.

But it doesn't just stop here. Another judge of the Supreme Court (whose name has been kept under wraps) is accused of receiving gifts, furniture and even a laptop, purchased from money embezzled from the Ghaziabad district court treasury. With him are 11 more judges from the High Courts of Allahabad and Chattishgarh.

For the judiciary this clandestine affair should be of most concern to the judges and jurists lest people of this country lose their faith in the institution and ask for a divorce. Much like Caesar.
