These promises are not a figment of my (limited) imagination but a copy-paste hack-job from your e-manifesto which (ahem) has begun to look more like Santa's wish-list. Also, amid your din, I never hear where you stand (on the fence?) when gay-mangoes want 377 jettisoned but flexible-yoga-mangoes offer courses to keep them from rotting instead? Or when Saffron-mangoes scream for the Ram Mandir and green-kerries for the Masjid? I can continue the mango-saga ad nauseam but I'm sure you see where I am coming from (and frankly, I have run out of mango types and begun using unimaginative pseudo-names instead).

The point is, please refrain from making "sweeping" promises to everyone for instant-delivery of the moon (and stars for frills) - If people have called Congress' and BJP's bluff, eventually, they will call yours too. How about convincing people (conjure Yogendra Yadav's temperament) on medium-to-long term, realistic plans instead and implementing them with exemplary finesse? Rome wasn't built in a day, India is far bigger. Your recent hasty-arbitrary policy decisions and self-righteous-vigilante-justice vis--vis selective-silence on important but potentially-controversial issues is far from good (not even good from far)

All my arguments so far are not to suggest the absence of an agreeable (albeit poisonous) breeding-ground for all mangoes - the f-word. Well, it's not the first word that comes to one's mind, but freebies (although the other f-word would form a good adjective here, for good reason). Barring the molecular structure, how is your post-election-free-water any holier than BJP's alleged pre-election-free-alcohol? The value and usage of all that's free is bound to move in opposite directions - to the ground and the ceiling, respectively. I mean, why spend on fixing that dripping tap if it stays within the magic number - 670? Right?
