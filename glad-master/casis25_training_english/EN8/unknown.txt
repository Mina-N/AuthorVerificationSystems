Contrary to popular misconception, preaching the value of work hasnt always been a central plank of the labor movement. The eight-hour workday, for example, became a core demand of labor, but only through the activism of revolutionary anarchists, not labor lobbyists. Some of these radicals were executed in Chicago after the 1886 Haymarket incident  in which a peacefully rally for the measure turned violent after an unknown assailant threw a bomb at police  because they dared declare that a workers life should not be based solely on toil.

Labors focus on work has enabled contemporary odious rhetoric that holds that ones paycheck should be relative to how much one personally suffers while earning it: Wall Street apologists have defended bankers on cable news because they work countless hours and sacrifice personal freedom and their families for their institutions, while teachers, who educate and care for our youth, are portrayed as comparatively unambitious slackers.
