Matters of social relationships of a pastor begin first with his immediate family, and henceforward extend to the church and the larger society.

In respect of his family, the pastor's interactions are first and foremost with his brothers, sisters, mothers, fathers, uncles and cousins. Such relationships should be those of love and mutual respect actually inspired by the pastor himself.

In our African society, particularly in Ghana, the pastor's extended family including his parents and siblings may often-times depend upon him for their livelihood; that is to say, they may frequently make financial demands upon him, careless of the fact that the pastor is, strictly speaking, not in any gainful or money-earning employment.

It is the pastor's ability to patiently tolerate the kindreds' visits or financial pleadings that portrays him as a real man of God. There is currently a debate on whether or not a pastor should remain unsaddled with, or completely insulated from, familial or kinship responsibilities. Opinions expressed on this issue have been varied; but on the whole, it is a sign of pastoral piety to mercifully give at least one's widow's mite to the needy kiths and kins. This is in line with the spiritual principle -'Give and it shall be given to you' (Luke 6:38).
