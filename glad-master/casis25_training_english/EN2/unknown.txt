We all  love foodie treats at Christmas, and theres nothing nicer than the excuse to give or receive something luxurious to devour. Abandon that fattie guilt trip and worry about the diet come January. In that light, pop over to Romeo Jones for a free nibble and a tipple of prosecco whilst browsing over their fancy wrapped panettonne and tempting hampers packed with their delicious produce. They have special deals for the night as do many shops who will be offering a discount. Le Piaf will be offering 10% off (their festive menu) as is Jags  nows the time to buy that handbag youve had your eye on.

Everyone loves a new book in their stocking. Village Books will be open too and as ever packed with the classics and latest releases. The Crown & Greyhound will be kicking off with their hog roast and everyone is free to join in with the carol singing. There will be a number of stalls outside, including Studio 45 who will have a selection of gifts such as jewellery, gift boxes and pictures by local artists such as Vic Lees line drawings featured on DOV of the Dulwich area and the popular Dulwich and Brockwell park illustrations by Clare Skilbeck, also featured on DOV plus of course the limited edition signed Quentin Blake prints.
