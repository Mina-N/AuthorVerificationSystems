Julian and I were the first of our group who were openly into punk. Hed spent the summer of 1976 on the Kings Road and, back in Suffolk, didnt realise that his new thing wasnt going to make the same sort of impact. Id been reading the NME and was listening anything I could find -- Saturday afternoons and evenings on Radio 1, bits of Caroline... Julian made the mistake of  wearing a safety pin in the lapel of his school blazer and got beaten up for it. I kept my head down a bit then a chap called Mark, one of Julians antagonists, heard God Save The Queen in the summer of 77 and suddenly it was cool. And we celebrated this fact regularly, well into the following year.
Daughter have unveiled their next release which will be a 5-song performance recorded in Londons iconic Air Studios with composer Joe Duddell  whose CV includes collaborating with Elbow and composing for the BBC Proms  and a 10-piece classical ensemble. The session will be released as a digital EP this Wednesday in which they were performed Shallows, Tomorrow, Still, Amsterdam and this free download of Youth. The idea for this crossover collaboration originally started as an idea for Portmeirions Festival No.6 in which they played with an 8-piece orchestra and it was deemed such a good idea thats been recreated and now up for release. Remember that you can catch Daughter playing the opening night of the Summer Series at Somerset House on July 10th.
