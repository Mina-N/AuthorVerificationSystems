There is one more incident when I tried for the cab in odd hours.

One night I am coming back to my place from Jaipur. The roadways bus left us at Dhaula Kuan at around 12.30 a.m. Before we can look for auto suddenly a running voice from roadside crosses my ears, "Burtania ,Wajir pur, Maduban Chok, Rohni......" as I turned my neck I saw a brand new TATA SUMO was parked and the driver was shouting for commuters of those particular places. I asked him about the charges he says Rs 15/- per person till Maduban chok. I bargained with him, he refuses. Then suddenly two more cabs parked behind that Sumo, then he agrees for Rs.10/- PP for Madhuban Chowk (other cabs are also for that route and Competition is there). We reached home in those odd hours with out any problem of transport and without paying any extra night charges.

One thing I realised later that these cabs are solving our problem but ARE THESE CABs ARE SAFE? Now that's a big question mark on this issue. Some says, "raat ke waqt ghar jane ke liye gaadi mil jaye aur kya chahiye". One man says, "safety ka kya kahen majboori ka souda hai" and "jab 10 rupe mein gaadi mil rahi hai to bus mein 12 kyo doon"? Recently there are no. incidents of misbehavior and sexual harassment with female staff by these cab drivers but commuters still using these cabs including ME.
