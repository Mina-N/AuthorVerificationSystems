Once you establish services, survivors of violence will access them, and in the process of providing tthe specialised care they need, critical information can be gathered on the type of violence faced by women and girls, as well as details on perpetrators, locations and motives. Service-based data gives a picture; an important and informed picture that may not be there otherwise. Collected safely and ethically, service-based data can inform us what services and programmes we need to respond to, mitigate, and prevent such violence from occurring.
