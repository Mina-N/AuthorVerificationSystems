Private operators can be encouraged to own shares in these units. They provide the bulk of buses to the fleet, while KSRTC which owns depots, repair and refuelling facilities provides the logistics and management. Private operators will benefit through marginally higher ticket rates and a share in the profits. Their repair & fuel bills could also come down. KSRTC, on the other hand, would benefit by freeing up many buses for use in more lucrative, long-distance routes. The profit sharing model can help boost the corporation's revenues by negating the need to compete with private buses in cities.
