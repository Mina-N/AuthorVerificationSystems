Which shops keep you coming back, even though you can buy cheaper online? Despite all the noise about online shopping, it still only accounts for a mere six per cent of Australia's total retail spend, according to the latest NAB Online Retail Sales Index. As I said on Wednesday, almost three quarters of that online spend is still with Australian online retailers rather than multinational giants like Amazon. So we're obviously willing to spend locally, if Australian retailers come to the party. You might think that six per cent of the household budget is pretty low and I'm sure people will swear they buy practically everything online, but remember we're talking about your total retail spend. That's not just gadgets and content, it's also expensive things like groceries, clothing, toys, furniture and whitegoods. Most people still tend to buy these things in a shop even if they do their research online. Even when it comes to high-tech gadgets, you'll often find a discount retailer which can practically match the best online price once you allow for delivery.
