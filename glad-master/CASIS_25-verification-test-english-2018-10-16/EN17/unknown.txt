Coincidentally, Dr Apraku and Dr Arthur Kennedy were part of the electioneering team for the NPP during the 2012 election campaign. As was to be expected, Johnson Asiedu  Nketia rubbished the possibility of Nana Addos flag bearership of the NPP. As far as Asiedu Nketia was concerned, they (NDC), welcome him with enthusiasm. We cant wait to face him in 2016.
