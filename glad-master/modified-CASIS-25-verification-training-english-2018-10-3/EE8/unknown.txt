Prime Minister Manmohan announced his first official press conference in the last four years. It is time to ask if Congress will fight back the rest of the Lok Sabha elections elections. Or do you think that Manmohan Singh's press conference will be more like a farewell speech of a defeated Army General? The jury might be out on that one but Congress is reacting to strikes in four provincial elections in Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh in special circumstances. There is no doubt that this choice raises an interesting question. Is it strong against the ruling Parliament? Where are many people saying pro-Narendra Modi wave? Will Aam Aammi become a powerful national force? Local parties like SP, BSP, BJD, JDU, TMC and AIADMK will become true producers of the king, or will we see people giving us a form of presidential election that trains for important instructions? The results will be difficult to predict, but 2014 will be one of the most intriguing decisions regardless of the outcome, and each country will deliver interesting results.
