It is not defenseless, because for some reason no one can question a reliable and trustworthy corruption. But this is the moment of opportunity. The current mistrust of popular power is influenced by the problem of Fran√Åois Oranjde in the second phase. One is a detailed charm, and this simple person can enjoy a charming love life. There is another fact that France has the same problem as us. Please think that there is a difference between an individual's private life and the details of public life. It seems strange and old. I'm still nostalgic, but I was very excited in England for a long time. Before terrible people like Robert Murdoch came here, everyone became a brutal and open melodrama, including the most intimate details of life. I do not know if it's true or not. I saw a wonderful 1967 film about divorce. Middle-class and middle-class citizens in Britain shared the most intimate details of their private lives in the most sincere, exciting and sometimes surprising way.
