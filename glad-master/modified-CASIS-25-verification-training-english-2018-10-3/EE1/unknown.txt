This year's BBC Easter is full of passion. It is an amazing moment reflecting every effort to introduce this historical event. When BBC began, some expressed concern about the Easter coverage. When I joined, I knew that we would be listening to comments from the public, working diligently to resolve problems, and balancing the future. This is my 3rd Easter BBC. Since I participated, I decided to provide a meaningful and relevant story to the public.

Since then, we have steadily built strong television content with documentaries presented by the likes of Bettany Hughes, Nicky Campbell and Ann Widdecombe on subjects as diverse as the future of Christianity, forgiveness and the perceived persecution of Christians in Britain.
This year, we decided to publish important television and radio programs. Preston Passion on the BBC Good Friday, the culmination of eighteen months of discussions, planning and efforts is to provide a direct event not only coincides with the week of pain, but a clear message that we take this issue seriously. We give dramatic programming, services, discussions and documents that call for reflection.
