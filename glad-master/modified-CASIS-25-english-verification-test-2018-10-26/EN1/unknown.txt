At 5:30 p.m. this week, the BBC will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the song, which is a beautiful song dedicated to the 50th anniversary. This problem had excellent results 50 years ago. From their humble beginnings, which were delivered by the Tabernacle of the Welsh Baptist Church in Cardiff on October 1, 1961, "Songs of Praise" became the national institution and the cornerstone of our religious and ethical programming. I was lucky to be one of almost 7,000 people when the program was recorded on Sunday, September 25 at the birthplace of Alexandria Television Palace. It was absolutely fantastic to be part of the audience and also to meet with many spectators from the past and the present, as well as with those who worked for this program for many years.
