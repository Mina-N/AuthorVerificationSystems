I am ashamed of not happening before the incident occurred. Before it happened they did nothing. I think that this is not a position to criticize politicians and police if possible. Home kya patthar maarun, jab maine hee yeh sab hone diya hain. I tried to distinguish between women and women's places like you, family. Now I have to disassemble them. It may be too late now. But now, we need to start. I hope next time that one of your people is rude, I will help protect myself. I am a supernatural hero, but since it is not an appendix, I can not attack it, but I have to fight for your people. I hope that this type of accident is no longer useful. This is the reason that a beloved Indian woman considers emotional spiritual courage, a spirit of strong existence, a creator of life that can not imagine human beings. This idea is wrong. I feel like you are crossing the street safely. Because sensitive and kind people like me know to live in the courageous city to protect the women's family. For women in our country.
