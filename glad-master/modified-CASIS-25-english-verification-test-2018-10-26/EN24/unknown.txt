When they create a service, victims of violence will receive these services and provide them with the professional help they need. They may collect important information about the type of violence that women and girls face, as well as about the perpetrators and whereabouts. Service data provides images of important and informed images that may not be available in other ways. Database services collected in a safe and ethical manner will tell you what services and programs are needed to solve problems, mitigate and prevent such violence. It is not enough to emphasize coefficients, statistics and figures, and not just data collection. For each number there are survivors. How do you use this information? We can save our lives and help women and girls heal and recover from such violence and injuries and restore dignity. Have you helped women and girls spend their time and resources checking for violence? Services that save lives and limited resources must effectively attract funds. Our slogan must first be first service.
