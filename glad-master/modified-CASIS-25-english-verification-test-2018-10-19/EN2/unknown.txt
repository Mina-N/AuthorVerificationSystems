Volunteers receive what amount of money in SaiCenter? Ask Japanese enthusiasts and US fans of Puttaparthi why they spent a lot of money in remote areas of India. I'm sure you'll find one in your country if I'm supposed to see magicians. I am very fascinated with Chris Angel because he is a wonderful magician: he can climb a wall and turn the coke into a cockroach. When I was a student, I celebrated Christmas, Christmas, Dusshera and Chinese New Year with the same enthusiasm as all other students and, like anyone who visits Barty during festivals. The only subject taught to all students from the first year to the last year in the studies of the Sri Sattiya Sai Institute are human values. What is studied? I love everyone and I serve everyone, eternal help and never hurt, Sathyam Vada, Dharmam Chara (telling the truth and justice). Simple mentality, but I sincerely believe that today I am a better person because of that.
