DHS says, a 15-year-old boy died this week, prompting two workers to be fired because of active Internet campaign. Quentin Wood was born of chromosome 9 ring and could not walk or take care of himself. When people were connected to the Internet, his campaign attracted people's attention. Valerie said Change.org collected thousands of signatures in Oklahoma in January 2013 and were cause for more investigation into repeat calls she made to report abuse and neglect. It's unfair and indifferent. Harper Woods is 28 years old. My sister came back and nobody moved. According to Oklahoma DHSinformation, death was a disaster and Wood actively pursued the tragic consequences of institutions, accidents and government agencies. According to the statement, this situation is in contradiction with institutional policy and appropriate measures for the protection of children.
