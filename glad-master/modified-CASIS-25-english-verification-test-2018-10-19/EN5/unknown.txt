Let's talk, ladies. First because it is the first day of the New Year: Happy New Year. This year, you are rich and happy. But wait.

I always read that word, nodded and thought: "Kitne Kameene, hotein hain kuch log". Then turn the page. Gangrape. Bora Hai, but hota hain, I say to myself. Huta Hai, in these remote villages of Rajasthan or Bihar. Hota-Hain at 3:30 in the morning. Hota hai, in a world that does not cross my world.\
