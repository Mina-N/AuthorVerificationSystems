In 2010, Wayne Rooney (Manchester United) threatened to leave Manchester United and did not have the ambition to say the club should sign the best players. When he asked publicly about his club's ambitions, his time at Old Trafford was widely known to have passed. But Sir Alex Ferguson is still in charge. The problem was resolved within a week. Rooney signed the new contract and greatly increased the wage increase. After 2013, the club won the second league in three years, but Rooney wanted to leave because the best players prevented him from participating. Ferguson insisted Rooney made an official transfer request on the air, and according to Manchester United, some people did not acknowledge this position, but they attracted some people's attention. As we all know, Fergie did not forgive Rooney for playing with the club in 2010 and gave Rooney a fantastic parting shot. His future looks at the intersection. Now, Robin van Persie and Shinji Kagawa are in the squad and the management of Manchester United is no longer desperate and will not be held for ransom once again. Most supporters of the Red Devil lost patience to Rooney, so Rooney was booed by most of his supporters during the victory procession. Nine years later, Manchester United seems to split the road. Chelsea made two proposals to Rooney, who the champions rejected with their new coach, David Moyes. Manchester United's announcement of a deal with Chelsea is a clear signal that they want to give the striker for the best price and contact more clubs, especially foreign players. Moreover, the United States is in a better position to deal with this issue. Two years remaining on Rooney's contract, they can still spend time deciding what is best for the club.
