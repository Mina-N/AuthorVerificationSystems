Robert Falcon Scott has arrived on this tragic continent after more than a hundred years of expedition, having opened the largest and youngest Antarctic research station and will be fully operational in the coming weeks. The British scientific community, founded by AECOM and Hugh Bruntona architects, continues to support modern facilities in the region for  25.8 million ($ 40.6 million). Our newest independent laboratory replaced Halley V in 2005, which has existed for 20 years and is the sixth of its type on the shelves of the ice platform. After studying the Royal Society of England in 1957, this region was used to study the magnetic field and the Earth's atmosphere of the British scientific base. Data from the Halley Research Station was directly related to the ozone hole discovered in 1985 by the British Antarctic Survey (BAS). To withstand extreme conditions, including prevailing winds of up to 145 km / h and temperature at an average outside temperature of minus 30  C (minus 22  F), the Halley VI is designed to be extremely rugged and high enough to withstand a high to stay on annual snowfall. Halley VI is mounted on skis with hydraulic lift. This will allow you to tow the lab regularly with special bulldozers so as not to lie on an iceberg that is broken by the floating ice shelf when it inevitably moves towards the sea at a speed of 400 meters per year.
