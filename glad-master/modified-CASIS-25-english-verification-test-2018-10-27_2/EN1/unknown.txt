\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 Hello, my name is Akhil Ahmed. I am responsible for religion and BBC religion and ethics. I wrote several articles on the BBC blog in this section. You can read this booklet. Today, I would like to introduce a series of new documentary films divided into three parts, "Ottoman Empire: European Muslim Emperor". In order to understand the relationship between the Middle East and Europe and Muslim at 9 o'clock Sunday morning, the Ottoman Empire has decided how it was invented, how it developed and how it dominates when it collapsed It was that it was physical. This series was sponsored by Rajih Omar 600 years ago in the history of the Ottoman Empire, claiming the role of the Islamic Empire, which many historians refer to. More difficult?\
\
The last stories of Islamic empires in Europe and the Middle East have been forgotten. This series is more than just "watching the story of 50 years and watching the 17th century". For example, I think Soliman the Magnificent (or Suleiman the Lawgiver) can do great things. Instead, we will focus on who these people are and how their stories are delivered. What can you learn from the Empire and the following countries? What do you know about the world we live in today? \
