"Nobody can check KSRTC", is the joke ... it's not made by a bad passenger, but a government official in the state of Kerala. The general acceptance of Oommen Chandy will throw the attractive possibilities of the transport giant. As a child, aana vandi (elephant bus) was the essential part of life in Kerala ... They were noisy and heavy animals adorned with red and yellow, associated with the logo of two big companies that earned the nickname of elephant, KSRTC buses were not friendly or smart. They were tall and slow. And the freight company is still big and slow. Too big for administration and too slow for customization. The company has a negative income gap of about 55 crore rupees a month. 30 rupees are spent each month, just to pay the retirement account of 33,000 "retirees" who retire at the age of 55! And this month, even this bill was not respected, which led retirees to consider the strike. The recent increase in fuel has been added to the monthly account of 6.5 crore rupees. In short, the only biggest bus operator in Kerala lives with prayers and government sponsorship. And even the sponsorship of the government has a price ... like the rupees of 476 crore rupees that the company has to give up every year because it is obliged to provide subsidized tickets.
