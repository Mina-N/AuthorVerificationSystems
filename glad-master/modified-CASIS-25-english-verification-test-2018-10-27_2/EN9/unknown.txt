I arrived on Saturday, June 15th. I live in Manchester but Cardiff has trains to big outdoor events. When I jumped onto a bike at the station, the children are still starving. One of these mornings! Dad is at home, so do not worry. Piccadilly's back paths are very quiet. When I went into the corner, I thought about breakfast and train times and there was a bird in the street. It's not uncommon in this city, but people rushing right away towards it, but the bird is still not moving. I contacted him closely, the dark feathers were blue, I was suddenly excited about the eyes of her movements and suspicious head. I stopped while the bird was escaping. I've been thinking about places you can hide.
