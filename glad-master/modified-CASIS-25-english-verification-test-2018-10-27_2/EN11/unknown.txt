Today no one believes in power. This is one of the main characteristics of our time. Regardless of where you are, there are lying politicians, corrupt bankers, corrupt policemen, deceptive journalists and corrupt media magnates, sinister children's artists, corrupt and greedy energy companies and uncontrolled security services. And what makes suspicion worse is that virtually no one is being prosecuted for scandals. Of course, no one at the top. In modern Britain it has always been us against them, but this general atmosphere of suspicion and mistrust is different. Previously, it was divided into political lines. The left was for us, and the conservative right was firm for them. But now politics has disappeared, because not one politician is trusted. Whether they are left or not, all politicians  are despised. They will never do anything for an ordinary person, only for them and their other corrupt friends in power.
